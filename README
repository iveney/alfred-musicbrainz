# Alfred Workflow for MusicBrainz

Leverages:

1. [PHP Workflows package](https://www.alfredphpworkflows.com/)
2. [PHP package for MusicBrainz](https://github.com/iveney/MusicBrainz.git)

## Improving MusicBrainz package
Some modification is needed to use the MusicBrainz package for newer version of PHP (see fork).

Original package also lacks many fields, my fork fixes some, but not complete. To develop this together, recommend this workflow:

1. Clone the remote repo
2. Install the package via a dev `composer.json`. Run `COMPOSER=composer.dev.json composer install`
3. Modify MusicBrainz package directly inside the alfredworkflow. Since it's symlinked, any change will update to the local repo as well.
4. Once it's done, push `MusicBrainz` to remote and use regular `composer.json`

```
# composer.dev.json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "/Path/to/local/MusicBrainz",
            "options": {
                "symlink": true
            }
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "joetannenbaum/alfred-workflow": "^1.1",
        "iveney/musicbrainz-php": "dev-master"
    }
}

```
